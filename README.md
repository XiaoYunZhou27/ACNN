# ACNN: a Full Resolution DCNN for Medical Image Segmentation
This repository provides the python code for the ICRA 2020 paper:
* Xiao-Yun Zhou, Jian-Qing Zheng, Peichao Li, Guang-Zhong Yang. **ACNN: a Full Resolution DCNN for Medical Image Segmentation**. ICRA 2020. 
This paper proposed a method for effective atrous rate setting to achieve the largest and fully-covered receptive field with a minimum number of atrous convolutional layers. Furthermore, a new and full resolution DCNN - Atrous Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN), which incorporates cascaded atrous II-blocks, residual learning and Instance Normalization (IN) is proposed.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5
* Tensorflow >= 1.9
* numpy
